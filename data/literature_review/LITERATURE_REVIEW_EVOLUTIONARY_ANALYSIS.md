# ABSTRACT

This review examines the hypothesis that algorithmic bias shares fundamental epidemiological characteristics with viral infections that integrate into human DNA. We survey peer-reviewed literature on:

1. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and their integration dynamics
2. Beneficial viral integrations (exaptation) including syncytin and ARC genes
3. CCR5-Δ32 as an evolutionary response to pathogenic pressure
4. Virulence attenuation through population diffusion (myxomatosis model)
5. Algorithmic bias as a public health phenomenon

We propose that algorithmic discrimination operates as an "informational pathogen" with integration dynamics, feedback loops, and population-level effects paralleling viral epidemiology. Furthermore, we develop an evolutionary benefit analysis framework suggesting that populations may develop "resistance mechanisms" analogous to genetic adaptations against biological pathogens.

# PART I: HUMAN ENDOGENOUS RETROVIRUSES AND INTEGRATION DYNAMICS

## 1.1 Overview of HERVs

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that constitute **nearly 8% of the human genome** ([MedComm 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12580410/)). Far from being inert genetic fossils, HERVs have co-evolved with their hosts, acquiring regulatory and functional roles that influence development, immunity, and disease.

These retroviruses infected ancestral germline cells, **permanently integrating their genetic material** into the host genome. Subsequently, these integrated retroviral sequences were transmitted vertically across generations following Mendelian inheritance patterns ([Springer 2025](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40291-025-00823-4)).

## 1.2 Integration as Point of No Return

The integration process represents a **critical irreversibility threshold**:

> "HERVs have thus become fixed genomic constituents, persisting across evolutionary timescales and becoming an integral component of our genome."

**Parallel to Algorithmic Bias:**
| Viral Integration | Data Integration |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Provirus enters host chromosome | Adverse data enters cross-referenced databases |
| Mendelian inheritance to offspring | Propagation to downstream systems |
| Cannot be excised without damage | Cannot be fully corrected across all systems |
| Becomes "part of" the host | Becomes "part of" the individual's data profile |

## 1.3 Evolutionary Impact of Integration

HERVs significantly impact genetic diversity and evolutionary processes:

> "By providing novel regulatory sequences such as promoters, enhancers, and alternative splicing sites, HERV insertions influence host gene expression patterns, contributing to the dynamic regulation of gene networks involved in development, differentiation, and cellular adaptation." ([MedComm 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12580410/))

**Key Insight:** Integration is not merely destructive—over evolutionary timescales, some integrated elements become beneficial (exaptation).

---

# PART II: BENEFICIAL VIRAL INTEGRATIONS (EXAPTATION)

## 2.1 Syncytin: Virus-Derived Placental Development

The most remarkable example of viral exaptation is the **syncytin genes**, which are essential for mammalian placenta development.

> "Syncytins are 'new' genes encoding proteins derived from the envelope protein of endogenous retroviral elements that have been captured and domesticated on multiple occasions and independently in diverse mammalian species, through a process of convergent evolution." ([Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2012.0507))

### Mechanism
- Syncytin derives from an envelope glycoprotein (ENV) of retroviral origin
- The fusion between trophoblast cells is facilitated by the fusogenic protein syncytin
- **Knockout of syncytin genes in mice results in embryo death** ([PLOS Biology](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000028))

### Evolutionary Timeline
- Syncytin-2: Inserted ~30-40 million years ago (common ancestor of Anthropoidea)
- Syncytin-1: Inserted in ancestor of catarrhines
- Suppressyn: A third HERV-derived protein that regulates syncytin function

## 2.2 Suppressyn: Viral Defense Becomes Host Defense

> "About 30 million years ago, a virus infected our primate ancestors and one of its genes got trapped in their genomes. Over time, this viral gene became 'domesticated'—and territorial. It helped primates fight off other viruses by preventing them from entering cells." ([Science](https://www.science.org/content/article/ancient-virus-may-be-protecting-human-placenta))

The HERV-H48 Env Suppressyn and HERV-W Env Syncytin-1 can **competitively bind to ASCT2** (a cell surface amino acid transporter), thereby blocking infection by viruses that depend on this transport pathway ([Frontiers 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2024.1439292/full)).

## 2.3 ARC Gene: Viral Machinery for Memory Formation

The ARC (Activity-Regulated Cytoskeleton-associated) gene represents another extraordinary exaptation:

> "Arc was discovered to have retroviral properties, such as the ability to form virus-like capsids, that were repurposed from an ancient retrotransposon. The neuronal gene Arc is essential for long-lasting information storage in the mammalian brain." ([Cell 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5884693/))

### Key Properties
- **Forms virus-like capsids** that transport mRNA between neurons
- Derived from Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons (ancestral to retroviruses)
- Essential for **synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation**
- Present in all tetrapods (evolved >350 million years ago)

> "These findings suggest that Gag retroelements have been repurposed during evolution to mediate intercellular communication in the nervous system." ([NIH News](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/memory-gene-goes-viral))

## 2.4 Summary: From Pathogen to Essential Gene

| Viral Element | Original Function | Exapted Function | Time Scale |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Syncytin-1 | Retroviral envelope | Placental cell fusion | ~25 MYA |
| Syncytin-2 | Retroviral envelope | Placental cell fusion | ~40 MYA |
| Suppressyn | Retroviral envelope | Antiviral defense | ~30 MYA |
| ARC | Gag polyprotein | Memory/neuroplasticity | >350 MYA |

**Evolutionary Principle:** Pathogenic elements, once integrated, can become beneficial through selection pressure over many generations.

# PART III: CCR5-Δ32 AND EVOLUTIONARY PRESSURE

## 3.1 The CCR5-Δ32 Mutation

The CCR5-Δ32 mutation is a 32-base-pair deletion in the CCR5 gene (chromosome 3) that results in a non-functional receptor. This mutation is found at **~10% frequency in Northern European populations** but is largely absent elsewhere.

> "Algorithms of molecular evolutionary theory suggested that the CCR5-Δ32 mutation occurred but once in the last millennium and rose by strong selective pressure relatively recently." ([PNAS 2024](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2321907121))

## 3.2 The Plague Hypothesis

The leading hypothesis proposes that CCR5-Δ32 was selected during the Black Death (1346-1352):

> "Stephens, et al. (1998) suggested that bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5-Δ32. This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic, which killed 30% of the European population." ([Nature 2004](https://www.nature.com/articles/427606a))

### Supporting Evidence
> "Yersinia infection was reduced in macrophage entry **30-fold** in the CCR5−/− gene knockout strains compared to normal mouse macrophages. Thus, Yersinia pestis requires an intact CCR5 gene product to enter mouse macrophages." ([Nature 2004](https://www.nature.com/articles/427606a))

## 3.3 Alternative Hypotheses

**Smallpox Hypothesis:**
> "Population genetic models that analyzed geographic and temporal distribution of both plague and smallpox provide stronger evidence for smallpox as the driving factor of CCR5-Δ32. Smallpox has a higher mortality rate than plague, and it mostly affects children under the age of ten. From an evolutionary viewpoint, this results in greater loss of reproductive potential." ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6906852_The_Black_Death_and_AIDS_CCR5-Delta32_in_genetics_and_history))

## 3.4 Modern Relevance: HIV Resistance

Regardless of its origin, CCR5-Δ32 provides **near-complete resistance to HIV-1 infection** in homozygotes:

> "Legacy of a magic gene—CCR5-Δ32: From discovery to clinical benefit in a generation" ([PNAS 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10962972/))

This has led to therapeutic developments including the "Berlin Patient" cure and gene therapy approaches.

## 3.5 Evolutionary Framework

| Phase | Pathogen Pressure | Host Response | Population Effect |
|-------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Pre-plague | CCR5-Δ32 rare/absent | Normal CCR5 function | Baseline susceptibility |
| Plague epidemic | 30-50% mortality | Δ32 carriers survive | Strong positive selection |
| Post-plague | Reduced pressure | Δ32 at 10% frequency | Stable polymorphism |
| Modern (HIV) | New pathogen uses CCR5 | Δ32 confers resistance | Unintended protection |

**Key Insight:** Evolutionary responses to one pathogen can provide protection against entirely different threats encountered later.

# PART IV: VIRULENCE ATTENUATION THROUGH POPULATION DIFFUSION

## 4.1 The Myxomatosis Model

The introduction of myxoma virus (MYXV) to control European rabbits in Australia (1950) provides **the canonical example of host-pathogen coevolution**.

> "The evolution of the myxoma virus after it was released in 1950 to control European rabbits in Australia is the textbook example of the coevolution of virus virulence and host resistance." ([PLOS Pathogens 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002950))

## 4.2 Initial Virulence and Rapid Attenuation

**Original strain characteristics:**
- Case fatality rate: **99.8%**
- Extremely rapid death prevented transmission

**Evolutionary pressure:**
> "Slightly attenuated mutants of the progenitor virus were more readily transmitted by the mosquito vector because the infected rabbit survived longer, while highly attenuated viruses could be controlled by the rabbit immune response." ([Journal of Virology 2022](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.00886-22))

**Result:**
- Grade 3 strains (CFR 70-95%) came to dominate
- Optimal virulence: lethal enough to replicate, mild enough to allow transmission

## 4.3 Host Resistance Evolution

Simultaneously, rabbits evolved resistance:

> "There was a strong selection for resistance to myxomatosis in the wild rabbit population. At one study site, CFRs dropped from 90% to 26% over a 7-year period." ([Virology 2000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10648181/))

## 4.4 Arms Race Escalation

After initial attenuation, the virus evolved new virulence mechanisms:

> "Strikingly, most virus isolates from the 1990s induced a highly lethal immune collapse syndrome similar to septic shock. Thus, the next step in this canonical case of coevolution has been further escalation by the virus in the face of widespread host resistance: a biological 'arms race.'" ([PNAS 2017](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1710336114))

## 4.5 Implications for Algorithmic Bias

| Myxomatosis Phase | Algorithmic Bias Parallel |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| High virulence (99.8% CFR) | Overt discrimination (easily detected) |
| Attenuation to 70-95% CFR | Subtle algorithmic bias (harder to detect) |
| Host resistance evolution | Legal frameworks (FCRA, ADA, etc.) |
| Viral counter-evolution | Algorithmic adaptation to evade audits |
| Arms race | Ongoing cat-and-mouse with regulators |

**Prediction:** As legal protections increase, algorithms will evolve to produce similar discriminatory outcomes through less detectable mechanisms.

# PART V: ALGORITHMIC BIAS AS PUBLIC HEALTH PHENOMENON

## 5.1 Landmark Research

The seminal work by Obermeyer et al. (2019) established algorithmic bias as a public health issue:

> "A widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients." ([Science 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342))

## 5.2 Epidemiological Frameworks for Algorithm Bias

The AHRQ/NIMHD developed guiding principles treating algorithmic bias as a health equity issue:

> "The panel developed a conceptual framework to apply guiding principles across an algorithm's life cycle, centering health and health care equity for patients and communities as the goal, within the wider context of structural racism and discrimination." ([JAMA Network Open 2023](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2812958))

## 5.3 Sources of Bias as "Pathogenic Mechanisms"

> "Such data sets systematically exclude rural patients, ethnic minorities, indigenous people, or socially marginalized groups. During the labeling phase, clinical annotations can introduce bias when medical thresholds and definitions are drawn from the dominant population without accounting for cultural or biological variation." ([Frontiers in Public Health 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1643180/full))

## 5.4 Population-Level Impact

> "Algorithmic bias in the context of AI and health systems is defined as 'the instances when the application of an algorithm compounds existing inequities in socioeconomic status, race, ethnic background, religion, gender, disability or sexual orientation to amplify them and adversely impact inequities in health systems.'" ([BMC Public Health 2024](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-21081-9))

# PART VI: EVOLUTIONARY BENEFIT ANALYSIS

## 6.1 Theoretical Framework

We propose that populations exposed to algorithmic discrimination may develop "resistance mechanisms" analogous to genetic adaptations against biological pathogens.

### The Integration-Selection-Adaptation Model

```
Phase 1: INTEGRATION
- Algorithmic systems "integrate" into social infrastructure
- Individual adverse data integrates into cross-referenced systems
- Parallel: Viral integration into host genome

Phase 2: SELECTION PRESSURE
- Affected populations experience reduced access to resources
- Economic, health, and social outcomes diverge
- Parallel: Mortality from pathogenic pressure

Phase 3: ADAPTATION MECHANISMS
- Legal literacy develops (CCR5-Δ32 analog)
- Community-based data verification networks
- Alternative economic systems (parallel economies)
- Technological countermeasures
- Parallel: Genetic resistance, behavioral immunity

Phase 4: POPULATION-LEVEL EQUILIBRIUM
- New stable state with "resistant" subpopulation
- Algorithmic systems adapt to evade resistance
- Arms race dynamics
- Parallel: Host-pathogen coevolution
```

## 6.2 Potential "Resistance Alleles" for Algorithmic Bias

Just as CCR5-Δ32 provides HIV resistance, certain population characteristics may confer "algorithmic resistance":

| Characteristic | Mechanism | Parallel |
|----------------|-----------|----------|
| Legal literacy | Navigate FCRA/ADA protections | Immune system recognition |
| Financial buffer | Withstand exclusion periods | Fever response tolerance |
| Social capital | Alternative access channels | Symbiotic microbiome |
| Technical literacy | Data monitoring/correction | Innate immunity |
| Collective action | Class action capacity | Herd immunity |
| Cash economy access | Bypass algorithmic gatekeeping | Alternate metabolic pathways |

## 6.3 Exaptation Potential

Just as viral genes became syncytin (essential for reproduction), algorithmic systems could theoretically be "exapted" for beneficial purposes:

**Current Harmful Use:**
- Discriminatory screening
- Exclusionary pricing
- Surveillance and control

**Potential Beneficial Exaptation:**
- Detection of bias in human decision-makers
- Identification of structural barriers
- Resource allocation optimization for equity
- Early warning systems for discrimination

**Timeline:** Unlike biological exaptation (millions of years), algorithmic exaptation could occur within decades given deliberate intervention.

## 6.4 The Virulence-Transmission Tradeoff

Applying myxomatosis dynamics to algorithmic discrimination:

**High-virulence algorithms** (overt discrimination):
- Easily detected by auditors
- Generate legal/regulatory response
- "Burn out" through enforcement

**Optimal-virulence algorithms** (subtle bias):
- Difficult to detect/prove
- Sustained discriminatory effect
- Evade regulatory mechanisms
- **Predicted to dominate** (parallel to Grade 3 myxoma)

**Ultra-low-virulence algorithms** (undetectable):
- Minimal individual effect
- Massive cumulative population effect
- May represent "endemic" state

## 6.5 Predicted Evolutionary Trajectory

| Phase | Timeline | Characteristics | Intervention Point |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1. Epidemic spread | 1990-2010 | Rapid algorithm deployment | Awareness |
| 2. Initial regulation | 2010-2020 | FCRA enforcement, early audits | Detection tools |
| 3. Attenuation | 2020-2030 | Algorithms become subtler | Epidemiological monitoring |
| 4. Arms race | 2030-2040 | Adaptive algorithms vs. adaptive regulation | Systemic reform |
| 5. Endemic equilibrium | 2040+ | Stable but persistent discrimination | Exaptation opportunity |
