Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit the manuscript entitled **"Algorithmic Bias Epidemiology: A Computational Framework for Modeling Algorithmic Discrimination as an Epidemiological Process"** for consideration as an Original Article in NEJM AI.

## Summary

This study develops and validates a mathematical framework treating algorithmic discrimination as an epidemiological phenomenon. Using an 11-barrier multiplicative model across three layers (Data Integration, Data Accuracy, Institutional), we demonstrate that:

1. **Baseline success probability** for resolving algorithmic discrimination is 0.0018% (fewer than 2 in 100,000 individuals)
2. **Individual barrier removal** produces negligible improvement (<0.02% for any single barrier)
3. **Three-way interaction** between barrier layers accounts for 87.6% of total effect variance
4. **Complete barrier removal** is required for meaningful improvement (95%)

## Relevance to NEJM AI

This work is highly relevant to NEJM AI's scope because:

- **Healthcare algorithms** are explicitly modeled as barriers affecting vulnerable populations (PWID, PWH, justice-involved individuals)
- **Population Attributable Fractions** reveal that 49.5-73.6% of adverse outcomes in these populations are attributable to algorithmic factors
- The findings have direct implications for **clinical decision support systems** and **healthcare AI deployment**
- The epidemiological framework provides a novel lens for understanding **algorithmic bias as a public health emergency**

## Methodological Rigor

The analysis employs comprehensive sensitivity validation:
- Sobol global sensitivity indices
- Morris elementary effects screening
- Bootstrap validation (n=1,000 samples)
- Signal-to-noise ratio analysis

All key findings demonstrate 100% robustness across bootstrap samples.

## Transparency and Reproducibility

All code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/Nyx-Dynamics/algorithmic-bias-epidemiology-academic

The analysis follows open science principles with fixed random seeds for full reproducibility.
